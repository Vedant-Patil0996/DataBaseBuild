week-2-day-1
created the pager system for tackling the durability part so that data doesnt vanish after java program is
closed or stopped. for now only single file implementation
->used page_size and offset concepts
->problems faced
1.in deletion as it would leave huge gaps in file
=>system is incredibly slow if we manually shift, so maybe dynamic allocation type smtg would work
sol: checklist concept(optimization)(I GOT CONFUSED MORE AHHHH )
